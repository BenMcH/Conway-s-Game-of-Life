Conway-s-Game-of-Life
=====================

Conway's game of life written in Java with an added UI and other features, such as custom rules.

With this GUI, you are able to make single steps through generations or you are also able to automatically run through many iterations automatically.

It also offers buttons to clear the board and add random cells.

The rule changer is the most helpful asset of this implementation of the Game of Life at this point in time. You are able to specify the number of neighbors that will keep a cell alive or the number of neighbors that will bring it to life. 

More features are planned for the near future such as custom colors based on the number of neighbors, the ability to save different rulesets, and possibly a brush editor.
